	- Social media engagement was measured with a series of questions assessing the extent to which participants used it in their daily lives. Participants were instructed to: ‘‘Please reﬂect on how you used social media (e. g., Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn) in the past week and report the number of times you used it under the circumstances listed below’’. Participants used a eight-point Likert style scale ranging from 1 = ‘‘Not one day last week’’ to 8 = ‘‘Every day last week’’ to rate ﬁve statements: ‘‘within 15 min of waking up’’ (M = 1.86, SD = 1.65), ‘‘when eating breakfast’’ (M = 1.66, SD = 1.65), ‘‘when eating lunch’’ (M = 1.98, SD = 1.82), ‘‘when eating dinner’’ (M = 1.69, SD = 1.63), and ‘‘within 15 min of going to sleep’’(M = 2.15, SD = 2.12). Principle components analyses indicated the ﬁve items loaded onto a single factor, explaining 59.27% of the observed variability, so scores were summed to create one social media engagement score for each participant (a= .82, M = 9.33, SD = 7.00).

	- A one item measure was used to assess an individual's daily use of Facebook. Responses were given on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (0e15 min) to 5 (Over an hour). [@buglass2017motivators, p. 250]

	- Social network intensity (SNI) was measured with a short scale drawn from a survey by Salehan and Negahban (2013), consisting of five items, e.g. “Visiting social networking sites is part of my everyday activity,” to be answered using a 7-point-Likert scale from “1 = never” to “7 = always.” [@oberst2017negative, p. 5]
